Beyond connecting riders, it minimizes inconveniences and risks during rides, serving as a virtual rearview mirror for all riders.

              <div class="overview_content">In today's digital age, online socializing has become a norm, and numerous social platforms cater to diverse user groups. However, we noticed a gap in the realm of motorcycles – there's a lack of platforms specifically designed for enthusiasts like us in Taiwan. As passionate riders, we identified this need within the community. Hence, we aim to create a platform that <strong>connects people who share a love for riding</strong>, enabling them to find not just riding companions but also like-minded individuals who share their passion for motorcycles.

                <div class="com_result_content">This project was a collaborative graduation project between two individuals, and it was my first attempt at creating a complete project. It involved ideation, gathering and researching user needs, and producing the entire design from sketches. I implemented a prototype of the app using SwiftUI, which marked my initial experience with Swift programming. Throughout the process, there were numerous iterations and learning experiences. I encountered various shortcomings and gained valuable insights.
                <br><br>
                During the conceptualization phase, I had an overflow of functionalities in mind, which led to the dilution or blurring of the most highlighted features and functions. My unfamiliarity with the design thinking process resulted in the omission of crucial factors, disrupting the consideration of finer details in the design process. There's still much to learn in terms of the design process and thinking, especially regarding user research and testing. Understanding the balance between different user concerns and needs, and how to precisely ascertain user requirements and pain points is a crucial aspect to master.
